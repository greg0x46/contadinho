 * detail is not one of these screens — it goes through `DetailPage`, with
 * its own way back to Open Banking.)
 *
 * There is no second explanatory paragraph: it used to repeat the
 * description in other words. Anything a user needs to know to act lives
 * next to the control it explains (a field hint, an empty state's hint).
 * `extra` is a page action like any other: it stays in the title row on a
 * phone, not in a bottom bar. Settings are narrow pages: a list or a form
 * across 1400px is unreadable.
