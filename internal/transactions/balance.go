// CashOnHand is how much cash sits in the user's non-credit accounts: the
// sum of the providers' reported balances. It is the one implementation
// every cash-side reader goes through — the timeline's t=today anchor and
// net worth's asset side — so those two views cannot drift apart.
//
// The reported balance is authoritative here, and deliberately so. A
// transaction the user marked "ignored" still moved real money through the
// bank account; "ignored" is a reporting decision about what counts toward
// income/expense totals (a transfer to an untracked account, say), not a
// claim that the money never left. Backing such a transaction out of the
// balance would report cash the user does not have.
//
// That is a statement about this number only, not about what a balance
// *reconstruction* should walk: timeline's series drops ignored rows (via
// money.MovedCash) because the ones seen in practice are duplicates and
// reversals the bank never counted as separate movements. The two rules
// never conflict on the number itself — nothing ever backs an ignored
// transaction out of the reported balance — and internal/timeline's
// eligibleRealItems documents where the remaining disagreement lands.
//
// This is the opposite of the credit-card side, where
// CreditCardTransactionTotal computes what is owed from eligible
// transactions rather than the reported balance — there, the question is
// "what will this bill charge me", which inclusion decisions legitimately
// shape.
//
// Credit card accounts are excluded: their balance is owed debt, not cash
// on hand. accountIDs optionally scopes the result; empty means every
// account.
