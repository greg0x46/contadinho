// claim. An "ignored" inclusion decision means "this shouldn't be here at
// all" (a reversal, a duplicate). A Transfer categoryKind means "this is
// here, and it is real, but it is my own money moving between my own
// accounts" — counting it would double-count the same money. Ignored is
// checked first because it is the user's most explicit statement, and
// because the frontend contract requires an ignored transaction to report
// exactly "ignored" (see totals_eligibility in frontend/src/api/contracts.ts).
//
// The transfer check is deliberately *last*, after every check that asks
// whether money moved at all. MovedCash reads ReasonTransferCategory as "the
// money really did leave the account", so that reason must never be reached
// by a transaction the later checks would have rejected: a transfer the
// provider has not settled, or one whose movement type cannot be classified
// into a direction, moved nothing yet, and reporting it as cash movement made
// every day before it read wrong in the timeline and in net worth (a
// PROCESSING transfer was reversed out of the anchor; an unclassified one was
// reversed out with the sign flipped). Ordering it last makes
// "transfer_category" mean exactly what MovedCash claims: otherwise eligible,
// excluded only because both legs would count the same money twice.
//
// categoryKind is the kind of the transaction's assigned internal category,
// or "" when it has none. Callers that compute *balances* rather than
// income/expense flows must pass "" — the transfer rule is a reporting
// decision and never corrects an account balance. See the comments at the
// call sites in networth/backfill.go and transactions/cardtotal.go, which
// pass Considered for the very same reason.
//

// themselves face the same distinction, and must not read the boolean as
// "this money did not move": see MovedCash below, and the
// transactions.TotalsEligibility.MovesCash method built on it.
