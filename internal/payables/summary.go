// LinkSummary is one of a payable's links together with everything read off

// of it comes from the single transaction row summarize already loads, so a
// caller never goes back to the database for the same row.
//
// Transaction is zero-valued and EffectiveAmount is zero when the link
// points at a transaction row that no longer exists — the same "no data,
// not an error" treatment linkEffectiveAmount gives a missing transaction.
// Such a link still appears here: it is one of the payable's links, it just
// contributes nothing.

// Summary is a Payable's derived state: settled/remaining amounts, the

// ever stored — it is recomputed from the payable's links on every read,
// which is the invariant this package exists to protect (see
// .specs/motores-de-dominio.md, princípio 1).
//
// Summarize is the one place that recomputation lives. Callers that need
// the numbers — the HTTP layer's payable DTO, the scenario handlers'
// "how much is left to plan", net worth's liability side — go through here
// rather than re-deriving it, so they cannot drift apart.
//
// Links carries the rows the amounts came from rather than a bare count, so
// a caller rendering the links (the payable detail view) reuses this one
// pass instead of reloading every link and every transaction behind it.
// Under SummarizeAsOf it holds exactly the links that counted as of that
// day, so every field of a Summary describes the same moment.
