// Package networth computes and snapshots the user's net worth (assets
// minus liabilities) over time. There is no background worker: a snapshot
// for "today" is written on every read (Snapshot, called from the HTTP
// handler before List), which is enough for a self-hosted app used
// sporadically. The cash figure comes from transactions.CashOnHand, the
// same implementation internal/timeline anchors its series on.

// Breakdown is a point-in-time decomposition of net worth into the
// categories the frontend's composition card shows. Assets = CashBalance +
// InvestmentBalance; Liabilities = CreditCardBalance + PayablesDebt;
// NetWorth = Assets - Liabilities.
//
// Receivables (payables.KindReceivable) are deliberately not part of this
// model at all: unlike a bank balance or investment, money someone else
// owes the user is a future possibility, not a realized asset — it carries
// collection risk this package has no way to quantify. A debt
// (PayablesDebt), by contrast, is a firm obligation regardless of whether
// it's ever collected on the other side, so it stays a liability.
//
// CreditCardBalance is the current bill cycle's eligible transaction total
// (transactions.CreditCardTransactionTotal), not financial_accounts.balance —
// the same figure the homepage's "Dívida total" widget folds in as
// future_installments_total, so the two pages agree.
//
// A payable debt is counted as a liability independent of any CREDIT
// account balance: nothing in this codebase guarantees a debt payable is
// "backed by" a specific credit card, so the two are summed as distinct
// liabilities rather than deduplicated — a known simplification.
