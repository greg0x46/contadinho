// Backfill reconstructs and stores net_worth_snapshots for every past day in
// [earliestCashTransactionDay, yesterday] that has no row yet — the full
// depth of available transaction history, not an arbitrary cap. It is safe
// to call on every request: days that already have a row (written by
// Snapshot, an earlier Backfill run, or anything else) are left untouched —
// the per-day INSERT below only ever fires for a captured_at gap, and even
// then uses ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING as a second guard rather than overwriting
// a real Compute-derived snapshot with a reconstructed approximation.
//
// Only three of Breakdown's four categories can be reconstructed for a past
// day:
//
//   - CashBalance: today's non-CREDIT account balances, walked backward by
//     reversing each eligible transaction's effect in turn (same
//     eligibility/inclusion rules the rest of the app uses — an ignored
//     transaction is never reversed, matching how it never entered the
//     balance's story to begin with as far as this app is concerned).
//   - CreditCardBalance: transactions.CreditCardTransactionTotalAt, which
//     already accepts an arbitrary reference date — reused as-is per bill
//     cycle, so it naturally reports 0 for a day before any known bill
//     closing.
//   - PayablesDebt: the same Links-based sum Compute uses, except a link is
//     only counted once its transaction's occurred_at is on or before the
//     day in question — a debt payment made next week hasn't happened yet
//     as of a backfilled day last week.
//
// InvestmentBalance is NOT reconstructed and is always 0 on a backfilled
// row. financial_investments.balance is a synced snapshot with no dated
// history, and the only other number available — net contributions — nets
// out to a residual gain/loss that was never observed at any specific past
// date (see internal/httpapi's contributionInfo). Any of "hold today's
// value flat", "use net-contributed as an approximation", or "reconstruct"
// would fabricate a number this app has no way to actually know, so
// backfilled points simply omit investments from both InvestmentBalance and
// TotalAssets rather than present a guess as fact. SnapshotRow.IsBackfilled
// is what lets the frontend flag this to the user instead of silently
// showing a lower total on past days.
