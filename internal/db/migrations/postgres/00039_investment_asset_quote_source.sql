-- Manual positions (assets no Open Banking connection ever reports, such as
-- Bitcoin, or B3 tickers held outside a synced connection) have no provider
-- quote to fall back on. quote_source/quote_symbol optionally point a manual
-- asset at a pluggable quote connector (see internal/quotes) that a
-- scheduled job uses to price it automatically; both stay NULL for an asset
-- priced only through manual valuations, which remains fully supported.
--
-- No CHECK pairing the two columns, to stay identical to the SQLite side of
-- this migration. "Both set or both empty" is enforced in Go instead, in
-- internal/investments/assets.go's normalizeAssetInput.
