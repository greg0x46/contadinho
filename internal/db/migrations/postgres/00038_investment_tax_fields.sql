-- Pluggy sends three fields for FIXED_INCOME holdings (CDB/LCA) that were
-- previously parsed nowhere and silently dropped: amountOriginal (the
-- principal originally applied), taxes (IR provisioned) and taxes2 (IOF,
-- regressive, nonzero only in the holding's first 30 days) — all three
-- empirically verified against real Nubank data. The app already computes
-- the correct net yield without them (investments_handlers.go's
-- applyYield/netContributed); this is purely additive detail for display.
-- Pluggy never populates any of the three for EQUITY — expected, not a bug.
--
-- Note: investment_operations already has its own unrelated "taxes" column
-- (a single manual-ledger operation's tax amount) — different table, no
-- collision, just don't confuse the two later.
