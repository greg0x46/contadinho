# Julius

Julius is a self-hosted personal finance tracker, built for a single
person to use locally or from an online installation. It syncs the activity of
your bank account and credit card through the
[Pluggy](#open-finance--pluggy) Open Finance API — which authorizes you to read
your own financial data, not to manage other people's — and then lets you
categorize transactions, automate recurring categorization with rules, and
track debts (such as installment purchases or loans) against the transactions
that pay them off.

It runs as a single Go binary with the React frontend embedded in it — no
frontend runtime in production. The default database is SQLite, with Postgres
as an option. For online access, the host must provide HTTPS.

## Domain documentation and contributing

Contributions, new features and refactors are welcome. Before touching an area
of the domain, see [`.specs/README.md`](.specs/README.md) — the navigation hub
of the `.specs/` folder, with the domain architecture
(`motores-de-dominio.md`), the current state of each feature
(`contextos/<context>/reference.md`) and the historical rationale behind design
decisions. When you finish a new feature or change an existing one, update the
matching context's `reference.md` (and the "Features" section below, if it is
relevant enough) in the same PR — stale specs hinder the next contributor as
much as stale code does.

## Why a single binary

Julius packs the application and the frontend into one binary, with
authentication configuration that does not depend on the host:

- **One file to run.** `go build` produces a single executable with the
  frontend already embedded. No Docker, no reverse proxy, no Node runtime in
  production (Node is only needed once, to build the frontend).
- **One file as the database (by default).** With SQLite — the default — data
  and sessions live in the `julius.db` file. Also keep the external
  encryption key when moving or restoring the installation. No database server
  to install or keep running. To run several Julius instances sharing a
  database in the cloud, Postgres is an option — see
  [Running with Postgres](#running-with-postgres).
- **Host-independent configuration.** The account is created from the
  terminal; the public origin and the encryption key come from configuration.
  The app does not depend on cloud SDKs or external authentication services.

## Features

- **Open Banking sync** — a background worker polls Pluggy periodically for
  new transactions and account data, recorded as auditable sync runs (history,
  metrics, failures) instead of a black-box import.
- **Statement import** — upload a Flash CSV, review the per-row preview and
  import it into a file-based account. Re-uploads and overlapping periods are
  recognized, with an import history and warnings for inconsistent data.
- **Transactions** — searchable/filterable transaction list, manual
  inclusion/exclusion (e.g. ignoring a chargeback or a duplicate) and
  categorization. Entries can also be created by hand in an existing account —
  same categorization and automation rules as a synced entry, with editing and
  deletion limited to these manual entries.
- **Automation rules** — condition-based rules that categorize new
  transactions automatically and can be applied retroactively to existing ones.
- **Payables (debts and receivables)** — track a real total (debt, installment
  purchase, receivable) and link the transactions that settle it, with
  eligibility rules for which transactions can be linked.
- **Categories** — a user-defined category catalog, with categorization
  history.
- **Recurrences** — register cash-flow commitments known in advance (salary,
  rent, subscriptions), reconciled against the real transactions that settle
  them via an automation rule.
- **Scenarios** — user-authored hypothetical projections ("what if I travel",
  "what if I change jobs"), or the installment plan of a debt/receivable —
  they never affect real totals unless explicitly included in a query.
- **Financial report** — a single time navigation (Actual → Today → Base
  Projection → Simulation): how much you will have on a future date, your
  lowest balance until then, and how hypothetical scenarios change that answer.
- **Net worth** — net worth snapshots and history (assets − liabilities) over
  time.
- **Investments** — integrated and manual investment accounts, goal-based
  portfolios, per-asset operations, manual valuations and optional automatic
  quotes (B3 and crypto). Contributions and withdrawals reconciled with the
  statement show up apart from spending, keeping their cash effect and avoiding
  double counting in net worth.
- **Browser authentication** — email and password login for the owner account,
  persisted sessions, logout and password change. No public sign-up.
- **Secrets encrypted at rest** — Pluggy credentials protected with
  AES-256-GCM by a key independent of the password, supplied by the environment
  or a file. The worker keeps running after restarts without requiring a login.

## Investments by account and goal

In **Investimentos**, register a manual custody account or use the grouping
created for a connection. Create empty positions for new purchases; enter an
opening balance only for holdings that already existed. Purchases accept
quantity, price, fees and taxes. The "deposit along with the purchase" option
records a contribution or reinvests income in a single action.

In the statement, open the entry and choose **Vincular a investimento** (link
to investment). Confirm the destination and the portion; the rest stays
available for another movement. The imported asset movement can be linked as
well. The **Revisar lançamentos antigos** (review older entries) button opens
the history with no period limit, without reclassifying it automatically.

Integrated accounts keep the balances reported by the institution. Use
**Vincular caixa da corretora** (link brokerage cash) when the imported
financial account already represents the same cash. Goals group positions from
any institution without changing their value. Manual quotes are dated;
corrections to operations recompute subsequent costs and are rejected if they
would produce negative cash or a negative position.

Contracts and limits are in the
[investments reference](.specs/contextos/investimentos/reference.md).

## Tech stack

- **Backend**: Go, `net/http` (stdlib routing, no framework), SQLite via
  [`modernc.org/sqlite`](https://gitlab.com/cznic/sqlite) (no cgo) by default,
  with optional Postgres via [`pgx`](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) — see
  [Running with Postgres](#running-with-postgres) — and migrations via
  [`goose`](https://github.com/pressly/goose) for both dialects.
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) /
  Pro Components, [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query), Vite.
- **Tests**: Go's standard `testing` package, [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) +
  Testing Library for components, [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for
  end-to-end.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+
- Node.js 24+
- A [Pluggy](https://pluggy.ai) account with a client ID/secret and at least
  one `item_id` for the account you want to sync — see Pluggy's
  [Get your API keys](https://docs.pluggy.ai/docs/get-your-api-keys) guide, and
  the [Open Finance & Pluggy](#open-finance--pluggy) section below. Additional
  banks are registered later, in `/open-banking`, by pasting each one's
  `item_id` — the client ID/secret is the same for all of them.

### Run the production build (single binary)

```sh
./build.sh
```

Before starting, configure the encryption key and create or migrate the
account. The server refuses to start without prepared authentication or with
an invalid key.

### Publish and install a version

Every push to `main` that passes CI publishes a GitHub release with the
`julius-linux-amd64` binary, `SHA256SUMS` and the provenance attestation
(`julius-linux-amd64.sigstore.json`), as long as there is something to
release. The version follows SemVer from the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) since the last
tag: `feat` bumps the minor, `fix`/`perf` bump the patch, and a breaking change
(`feat!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) bumps the major (the minor while on
`0.x`). Other types (`docs`, `chore`, `refactor`…) and non-conventional commits
do not create a release. To see locally what the next version would be, run
`scripts/next-version.sh` (or `--notes` for the release notes) after
`git fetch --tags`.

To install, download the binary from the release, verify the checksum and run
it with the configuration described in the next sections; how to start it and
keep it running (system service, container, etc.) depends on your environment.

### Authentication and encryption key

Generate a 32-byte Base64 key **once**, in a file outside the repository. The
example refuses to overwrite an existing file:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/julius"
(umask 077; set -C; openssl rand -base64 32 > "$HOME/.config/julius/master.key")
export JULIUS_MASTER_KEY_FILE="$HOME/.config/julius/master.key"
export JULIUS_PUBLIC_URL="http://localhost:4200"
```

Alternatively, provide the Base64 value in `JULIUS_MASTER_KEY` through your
host's secrets mechanism. Set exactly one of the two sources. Do not put the
value in the repository, arguments, logs or `VITE_*` variables.

`JULIUS_PUBLIC_URL` is the origin as seen by the browser, without a path or
trailing slash. For online use, use `https://your-hostname`; HTTP is only
allowed on `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `::1`, for development. HTTPS may be
terminated externally; the application does not trust proxy headers to choose
the cookie policy or the allowed origin.

For a new database:

```sh
./julius auth init -db ./julius.db
./julius -db ./julius.db
```

The command asks for an email and a non-empty password in an interactive
terminal, without echoing the password. There are no length or composition
rules: the choice is up to the user. Sign in from the browser and configure the
Pluggy credentials under **Configurações** (settings); the optional Item ID
registers a new connection. Additional connections remain available under
**Open Banking**.

When upgrading from Contadinho, replace its `CONTADINHO_*` environment
variables with the corresponding `JULIUS_*` names. Julius does not read the old
configuration names. If `julius.db` does not exist but `contadinho.db` does,
Julius keeps using the existing database automatically; if both files exist,
it uses `julius.db`. Existing browser sessions need a new login.

To migrate your existing database:

1. Stop the old version and take a consistent backup of the database.
2. Configure and keep the new key.
3. Run `./julius auth migrate`.
4. Enter the old unlock password, your email and the new login password.
5. Start the application with the same key configured.

The migration re-encrypts every secret and creates the account in a single
transaction; failures never leave a partial conversion. The old verifier is
removed and a second migration is refused. Keep the earlier backup to roll back
to the old version: after the migration, the old binary cannot read the new
secrets. Do not run the migration while the application is running.

Keep a safe copy of the key separate from the database backup. Password
recovery does **not** recover a lost key. Replacing the file with another key
is not rotation: the server will refuse to start. Key rotation is not part of
this version.

To regain access from the terminal while keeping encryption:

```sh
./julius auth reset-password -db ./julius.db
```

This command does not need the key, requires a new password and revokes every
session. Changing the password under **Configurações** requires the current
password and also ends every session. **Sair** (log out) ends only the current
browser session.

Sessions last at most seven days, expire after 24 hours of inactivity, and
survive restarts. Every private access is checked in the backend. Login accepts
up to five attempts per minute per email and thirty per minute per process; the
limit resets with the process. HTTP writes require an `Origin` equal to the
configured origin and `X-Julius-Request: 1`.

Under **Configurações > Acesso**, the owner can disable authentication.
Disabling it requires a valid session; after that, anyone who can reach the
instance can read and change all data without logging in. Re-enabling it is
allowed from open mode and makes subsequent requests require a session
immediately. Origin checks for writes stay active in both modes. The preference
is stored in the database; if it does not exist, protected mode is used, and if
it cannot be read the API becomes unavailable — it never opens because of a
configuration failure.

### Running with Postgres

SQLite remains the default for local use. To run against a shared Postgres —
for example, several Julius instances pointing at the same cloud database —
pass a `postgres://` (or `postgresql://`) DSN to the `-db` flag instead of a
file path:

```sh
./julius -db "postgres://user:password@host:5432/julius?sslmode=require"
```

The driver is detected automatically from the DSN prefix. Postgres schema
migrations are applied automatically, just like the SQLite ones. Migrations
take a Postgres advisory lock, so several instances can start at once: one
applies the pending migrations, the others wait (up to about 5 minutes) and
then skip them. The `auth init`, `auth migrate` and `auth reset-password`
commands accept the same DSN in the `-db` flag or in `JULIUS_DB`. Sessions and the account live in
the database; the encryption key stays outside it.

The Postgres connection pool can be tuned through environment variables
(SQLite ignores them and always uses a single connection):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JULIUS_DB_MAX_OPEN_CONNS` | `10` | Maximum open connections per instance (integer >= 1). |
| `JULIUS_DB_MAX_IDLE_CONNS` | max open | Idle connections kept for reuse (integer >= 0, capped at max open). |
| `JULIUS_DB_CONN_MAX_LIFETIME` | `30m` | Go duration after which a connection is recycled; `0` = unlimited. |
| `JULIUS_DB_CONN_MAX_IDLE_TIME` | `5m` | Go duration an idle connection is kept; `0` = unlimited. |

An invalid value makes startup (and any `-db` command) fail with an error
naming the variable, instead of silently falling back to the default.

The background sync worker assumes only one instance runs it at a time — it
does not currently coordinate claiming sync runs across multiple
processes/instances.

#### Documenting the schema with SchemaSpy

`docker-compose.schemaspy.yml` runs [SchemaSpy](https://schemaspy.org/) against
a development Postgres reachable from the machine (`host.docker.internal`) and
writes the HTML to `schemaspy/output/` (a git-ignored directory). It is not the
application's compose file. The password is required; user, database and port
default to `admin`, `julius` and `5432`:

```sh
SCHEMASPY_DB_PASSWORD=... docker compose -f docker-compose.schemaspy.yml up
# optional: SCHEMASPY_DB_USER, SCHEMASPY_DB_NAME, SCHEMASPY_DB_PORT
```

Then open `schemaspy/output/index.html`.

### Scheduled sync

Since the API routes require a browser session, an external cron can no longer
trigger `POST /api/sync-runs`. Instead, set `JULIUS_SYNC_SCHEDULE` so the
process itself queues a sync of every active connection once a day:

```sh
export JULIUS_SYNC_SCHEDULE="06:00"                  # process local time
export JULIUS_SYNC_SCHEDULE="06:00 America/Sao_Paulo" # or with an explicit IANA time zone
```

If the process is down at that time, the pending sync is queued as soon as it
starts; a connection that already synced (including manually) after that day's
time is not repeated. Empty disables it.

### Automatic quotes

Investment assets with automatic quotes enabled have the price of their manual
positions fetched automatically and stored in the asset's price series. The
position value is computed on every read (quantity × latest price); a manual
valuation dated on or after the latest price takes precedence over it. Fetching
is opt-in: set `JULIUS_QUOTES_SCHEDULE` (same format as the sync schedule)
to run once a day and when the process starts. Providers are tried in order,
with automatic fallback; `JULIUS_QUOTES_PROVIDERS` sets the order
(comma-separated; an omitted provider is disabled; an unknown name prevents
startup):

```sh
export JULIUS_QUOTES_SCHEDULE="19:00 America/Sao_Paulo"
export JULIUS_QUOTES_PROVIDERS="yahoo,brapi,coingecko" # default
```

By default Yahoo Finance is the primary source for both markets; brapi is the
B3 fallback and CoinGecko the crypto one. The optional brapi token is
configured in the UI. Details in the
[investments reference](.specs/contextos/investimentos/reference.md#cotação-automática).

Assets are registered with a financial class (fixed income, variable income,
multi-market, currency, crypto assets or other) and an instrument type. The
quote market is derived from the type; fixed-income and crypto ETFs can use B3
prices.

To load an optional starter catalog with 27 well-known assets:

```sh
go run ./cmd/julius seed investment-assets
```

The command uses `JULIUS_DB` or accepts `-db path-or-DSN`. It can be run
again without duplicating or overwriting entries, and it does not create
positions or balances.

### Run for local development

After configuring the key and preparing the account with
`go run ./cmd/julius auth init` (or `auth migrate` for an old database),
the script below starts the backend and Vite together. The frontend gets hot
reload and `/api` requests are forwarded to the backend automatically:

```sh
./dev.sh
```

Open the URL the script prints on the `Frontend:` line (`http://127.0.0.1:5173`
by default). The script uses exactly that origin as the default
`JULIUS_PUBLIC_URL`, and the backend strictly compares the browser's
`Origin` header against it: opening `http://localhost:5173` instead, or having
already exported another value in `JULIUS_PUBLIC_URL`, results in a 403
`invalid-origin` on login and on every POST/PUT/DELETE. If you prefer another
host, change `VITE_DEV_HOST` (the script derives the origin from it) instead of
exporting the URL by hand. `Ctrl-C` stops both processes. To override host and
ports:

```sh
JULIUS_DEV_ADDR=localhost:8100 VITE_DEV_HOST=localhost VITE_DEV_PORT=5174 ./dev.sh
```

For machine-specific configuration, create a `.env.local` at the repository
root (ignored by git) with `KEY=value` lines; `dev.sh` loads that file before
starting. E.g. `JULIUS_DB`, `JULIUS_MASTER_KEY_FILE`, ports and, to
reach Vite through another domain, `__VITE_ADDITIONAL_SERVER_ALLOWED_HOSTS=<host>`.

If the dependencies are not installed yet, run `cd frontend && npm install`
once before starting the script.

### Tests and checks

```sh
# backend
go build ./...
go vet ./...
go test ./...

# frontend
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

The Postgres integration tests are skipped unless
`JULIUS_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` points at a disposable database. They reset its
`public` schema, so run them with `go test -p 1 ./...`, as CI does.

The frontend suite runs as two Vitest projects (jsdom and plain Node); see
[`frontend/TESTING.md`](frontend/TESTING.md) for the split and worker count.

`npm run test:e2e` (Playwright) is declared in `package.json` but has no
`playwright.config.*` or tests yet — scaffolded, not implemented.

## Open Finance & Pluggy

This project only exists thanks to Open Finance regulation in Brazil and to
[Pluggy](https://pluggy.ai), the Open Finance infrastructure provider whose API
Julius integrates with. Pluggy connects to more than 130 Brazilian
financial institutions and, as a Payment Initiation Service Provider (ITP)
regulated by the Central Bank, offers applications like this one a
standardized, authorized way to read account balances, transactions and
investment data on the user's behalf — turning "my data is mine" from a slogan
into something an independent developer can actually build on, without a
bespoke integration with each institution.

All credit to the Pluggy team for this infrastructure and for making Open
Finance access viable for small/independent projects. See
[pluggy.ai](https://pluggy.ai) to learn more about the platform, and
[Get your API keys](https://docs.pluggy.ai/docs/get-your-api-keys) for a
step-by-step guide to obtaining the client ID/secret this project asks for
during setup.
